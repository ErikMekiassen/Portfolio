I deploy the latest commit and PRs with Vercel and those are all I support. If you want help deploying this,
then I'd be happy to help.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability (exploit, bug, etc) please do so in the issues page. Make sure it's reproducible, and
occurs **ONLY** on this project. If it's a problem with Next or React, please report it at their respective repositories.
